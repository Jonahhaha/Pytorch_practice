# Pytorch_practive

I am using guns csv file to test some deep learning. To generate some graphs and understanding the Nerual Network. 

M1. Manual Neural Network with Tensors and Gradient Descent

M2. Using PyTorch's torch.nn.Sequential for a Simple Feedforward Neural Network

Still work on progress ~
